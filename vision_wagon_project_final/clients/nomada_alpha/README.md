# Nómada Alpha Scaffold

This directory is a placeholder scaffold for the Nómada Alpha client (0.0) of Vision Wagon. It includes:

- `api/`: FastAPI micro-API (port 8080) with a `/ping` endpoint and RabbitMQ integration.
- `dashboard/`: React frontend (Vite, port 3000) displaying API status, with Cypress tests.

**Note for Manus**: This is a minimal setup to ensure compatibility with the `docker-compose.yml`. Please complete the implementation (e.g., API endpoints, dashboard features, and tests) as per the project requirements.
